# Write A Program

To achieve the goal, we shall firstly denote $n$ as the shift amount, $R_0$ as the register that conclude the shifted bit pattern. 

1. Attain the most significant bit of $R_0$ and shift $R_0$ to the left for one bit.
2. Put the bit to the least significant bit of another register $R_1$, then shift $R_1$ to the left for one bit.
3. Repeat the process for $16-n$ times.
4. The bit pattern in $R_1$ is the required answer.
