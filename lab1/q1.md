# 1. Run A Program

## $1$ 
The last digit of my student ID is '1', and the data at menmory x3015 is 'x0000'.

## $2$
The program adds the result of previous two iterations together as a new result. Thus it calculates the Fibonacci sequence.

## $3$
There are two bugs in the original code:
1. The value of registers are not set to zero at the beginning of the program.
2. Denote $F_n$ as the result of the program with input $n$. We can find that $F_0=F_1=F_2=x0000$, which doesn't satisfy the definition of the Fibonacci sequence.  

The refined assemble code is shown as follows.
```lc3
                .ORIG   x3000
                LD      R1, INPUT
                LD      R2, OUTPUT
                LD      R3, ONE
                LD      R4, ZERO
                LD      R5, ZERO

                ADD     R1, R1, #0
                BRNZ    F0
                ADD     R1, R1, #-1
                BRZ     F1

LOOP            ADD     R1, R1, #-1
                BRN     END_LOOP
                ADD     R5, R3, R4
                ADD     R4, R3, #0
                ADD     R3, R5, #0
                BRNZP   LOOP

F0              AND     R5, R5, #0
                ST      R5, OUTPUT
                HALT
F1              AND     R5, R5, #0
                ADD     R5, R5, #1
                ST      R5, OUTPUT
                HALT
END_LOOP        ST      R5, OUTPUT
                HALT
